This is just me jotting down my notes for things
I would like to change for v0.3.

Features:
    - Entity scaling
    - Adjust logic so that an entity's position
        typically refers to its center rather than
        upper-right corner.
    - Make text-drawing less hacky (by which I mean,
        move the hackiness into engine code so the 
        user doesn't have to think about it)
    - Fix music being broken on Linux (maybe)

Bugs:
    - The framerate seems to be unlimited on my laptop
        but not on my desktop. Why? Both should have
        nearly identical environments.

Quality of Life:
    - Constant static Vector2 for (0, 0)
    - center() function for rects
    - Additional constructor for rects which only
        takes a width and height. Assumes x and y are 0
    - Functions to add, subtract, multiply and divide
        Vectors by scalar values

Examine more closely:
    - Is it necessary to pass the graphics context into
        each call to Entity.draw()? If we want the graphics
        context, can we just use FUTZ.graphicsContext?
    - I want to prevent passing-by-reference with
        geometry classes (Vector2 and Rect) whereever
        possible. If I pass a rect into the constructor
        for a RectEntity, does this copy the rect like
        it should or no?
